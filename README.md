As result is showing majority of stock investments have positive return for the year of 2017 and only 2 stocks (ENPH & RUN) remained positive return during year 2018. Refactored script is showing significant reduction of script running time comparing to the original script.

## Summary

#### Advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code

Advantages of refactoring the code are reducing the script running time and increasing the readability. 

Disacvantages of refactoring the code are the complexity of the script that takes longer to write and debugging.  

#### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

The only pro I noticed for current VBA script is that it shortened script running time. Before refactoring, the VBA script took around 1 second to run and after refactoring, it tooks less than 1 second. This would be beneficial when analyzing large amount of data as current file is relatively small. 

Cons are it's hard to understand for someone who just started to learn coding and it takes a lot of effort to make the code work.
